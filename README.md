# Basic Python Skeleton
A python project layout, just the way I like it.

# FAQ
## Can I contribute?  
Sure, but I probably won't merge any PRs. I suggest forking this repo and setting your own defaults. If you DO have something cool to add that doesn't bulk things up, feel free to PR.
## What license does this use?
MIT (see LICENSE.md)
## I don't like it this way  
That's not a question
